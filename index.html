                        <li>In a pan add sugar, water and a dash of lemon juice. Bring it to a boil and cook till it become a one string consistency. At this stage remove 50% of the sugar syrup into a bowl and keep aside. Remember this sugar syrup is the thick syrup which will be used later.</li>
                        <li>Now heat the remaining syrup in the pan and add ½ cup of water. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat. This is the thin sugar syrup in which we will dip the gulab jamun first. Make sure when the gulab jamuns are dipped into this syrup the temp of it should be luke warm.</li>
                        <li>In a pan boil milk. Separately mix together lemon juice with a dash of water and add it to the boiling milk to split it. Once it is split turn off the heat and strain it using a muslin cloth. Dip the muslin cloth in cold water to wash off any lemon taste and squeeze gently to remove the water. Place the chenna on to the table and rub it into a smooth paste using your palms. Keep aside and rub khoya with your palms on to the table. Mix together chenna, khoya and maida and knead like a dough.</li>
                        <li>Divide the dough into small balls and shape them into round spheres. Place these spheres in a fridge for 15min. In the mean time heat the oil to medium hot and add the dough balls to the oil. Carefully rotate the oil so that the gulab jamuns cook evenly</li>
